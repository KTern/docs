A project sign-off is essential to formally close a project or acknowledge delivery of a key deliverable. a sign-off sheet is a document signed by all stakeholders. It states:

1. The project’s intended goals and whether they were met or not.
2. The project’s key deliverables and whether they were actually delivered
3. Comments and observations, if any
4. The project start and end dates

The document is then signed by all involved parties. Their signatures formally (and more importantly, legally) close the project.

A complex project will have a sign-off sheet running into dozens, even hundreds of pages. Government contracts, for instance, usually have “sign-off books”, not just sheets.

### Signoff Hierarchy

1. Sign-off Group

#### Sign-off Group

The sign-off group is the collection of sign-off items categorized based on Project phases or deliverables.

#### Sign-off Item

The sign-off item states all practical and necessary information one would need to confirm what kind of project had taken place, who was involved, when this took place, as well as the specific elements making up the project.
