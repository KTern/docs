On successful creation of a new Project, the user will be landed up in Project Launchpad. Project Launchpad screen provides you the list of Projects in which you are a member of the Project. NOTE: The user must accept the invitation to see the Projects in Launchpad.

Once you login to KTern.AI, youâ€™ll be taken to the Project Launchpad. A project launchpad is nothing but a repository of all projects that the user is a part of. You can create a new project for an S/4HANA Implementation, System Conversion, Selective Data Transition, SuccessFactors implementation or C4C implementation as well from this window. In addition, KTern can be used in the Run Mode of any project.
