## Information Collection

Personal Information (“PI”) refers to any information that relates to an individual who may be identified from that data, or from a combination of a set of data, and other information which is or may be in possession of KTern. Such information may include, but not be limited to, a first and last name, e-mail address, a home, postal or other physical address, or any other information required to provide a service you requested, such as title, birth date, gender, occupation, industry, etc.
<br>

When you browse KTern’s Website, you do so anonymously. KTern does not collect PI, including your email address. However, certain information such as your IP address, demographics, your computers’ operating system, browser type, internet Service Provider (ISP) and any other information your browser may send to us, may be collected (through means of ‘log files, ‘clickstream data’ etc.) in order to provide better usability, troubleshooting, site maintenance and to understand which parts of the website are visited, how frequently and the duration of the visit. Also, because we rely on third party commercial software and programs to operate our servers, we may inadvertently collect PI due to certain automatic functions or features contained in such software or due to certain software changes or upgrades. We will use reasonable efforts to remove any such information after we discover such information in our systems.
<br>

KTern collects PI through the Website only when you wish to receive additional material about our product, such as application notes, products features, technical information, etc., or when you submit your information to KTern for any other reason. When you do any of the said actions, you thereby agree to be bound by this Privacy Policy and to the use of your PI by KTern as described herein.
<br>

KTern receives and/or collects PI from you to enable certain services that we offer, including without limitation, access to support services, which may or may not require you to create an account and provide us with certain information, such as your name, email address, the Product and/or Service you have purchased or are interested in purchasing, the name of your company name, your job title, your company’s address and country, and work phone number, as well as a password you will use for such an account, and additional PI should you choose to provide it.
<br>

KTern does not intend to transfer your PI to unaffiliated third parties without your consent, except to the limited extent provided herein.
<br>

## Use of PI

KTern uses information for several general purposes: to fulfill your requests for certain information and services, to keep you up to date on the latest announcements, updates, special offers or other information. KTern may also use your information to send you direct marketing information or contact you for market research. If at any time you do not want to receive our advertisements you can “opt out” using the link in the mails sent to you.
<br>

Since KTern is a global group, your PI may be shared with other KTern offices or subsidiaries around the world. All such entities are governed by this Privacy Policy and/or are bound by the appropriate confidentiality and data transfer agreements. Without derogating from the generality of the above, your information may be stored and processed in the United States or any other country where KTern, its subsidiaries, affiliates, agents or partners are located.
<br>

KTern may send your PI to other companies or people only under any of the following circumstances:
<br>

1.  when KTern has your consent to share the information;
    <br>
2.  when KTern needs to share your information with our third-party service providers and partners for the sole purpose of such third parties assisting us with our business operations and to provide our Services and Products. Such information may be transferred to other countries (including but not limited to the United States where a third party hosting services are used). We use commercially reasonable efforts to only engage or interact with third party service providers and partners that post a privacy policy governing their processing of PI, to limit the information provided to service providers to that which is reasonably necessary for them to perform their functions, to require them to agree to maintain the confidentiality of such information, and to comply with applicable data privacy legislation;
    <br>
3.  to enforce KTern’s Terms of Use; or
    <br>
4.  to protect personal safety, the public or KTern’s Website, Services and Products.
    <br>

KTern may use Anonymous Information (as defined below) or disclose it to third party service providers in order to improve our Products or Services. We may also disclose Anonymous Information (with or without compensation) to third parties, including advertisers and partners, to indicate performance benchmarks or other data metrics about the use of the Services. “Anonymous Information” means information which does not enable identification of an individual user, such as aggregated information about the use of our Services.
<br>

KTern may also process your PI for profiling of our customers for marketing and sales processes
<br>

**Consequences of not providing Personal Information** You are not legally obligated to provide us PI, and you hereby confirm that providing us PI is at your own free will. By using our Website, Products and Services, you consent to the terms of this Privacy Policy and to our collection, processing and sharing of PI for the purposes set forth herein.
