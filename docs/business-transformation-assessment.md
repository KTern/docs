Without a proper understanding of the landscape and the knowledge of how each of the processes is getting affected, it is literally impossible to build a proper digital transformation plan. But. KTern scans the entire ECC system and empowers customers with data and drive organizations to transform digitally.
It provides the complete business process mapping at 6 levels. It starts from your Line of Business and goes all the way down to the granular Process Steps. It hierarchically organizes business processes till the following levels –

**L1 – Line of business**

**L2 – Process group**

**L3 – Scope item**

**L4 – Process variant**

**L5 – Process step**

The above screengrab from the product consists of all the business processes present in the scanned system. You can drill down any one of the processes. For example, if you want to drill down ‘Finance’ as a Process, you can drill it down to the nth level, which consists of the different Process Steps that are configured in the system. This would provide a bird's eye view of the current processes in the existing system along with the stakeholders, roles, and the different technical objects involved in the process.

The primary purpose of providing such detailed insights is to help the customer understand the AS-IS process and map it to their existing KPI's. In addition, the process maps also provide a list of SAP users involved in the respective processes, associated FRICEW objects, test cases, and change management that would be involved in terms of new Fiori-based user experience. It also provides training suggestions when the customer enters the new world.

KTern’s Digital Maps also helps the Subject Matter Experts at the customer’s place to identify the best way for managing processes and reports any deviation in the current system. This sets the processes right when the customer moves to the new Digital Core of SAP S/4HANA.
