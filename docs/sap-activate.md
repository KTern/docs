### Key Components of SAP Activate

- ### Phase

  - Phases are stages of the project. At the end of each phase, a quality gate exists to verify the completion of the deliverables.

- ### Work Package

  - A deliverable is an outcome that is delivered during the course of the project. Several deliverables are included within a work stream.

- ### Task

  - A task is work to be performed. One or several tasks comprise a deliverable.

- ### Accelerator

  - An accelerator is a document, template, or a web-link that helps a consultant, a customer, or the PM perform the task and complete the work faster or with less effort.

- ### Workstream
  - A workstream is a collection of related deliverables that show time relationships within a project and among other streams. Streams can span phases and are not necessarily dependent on phase starts and end.
