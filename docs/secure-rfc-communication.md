SAP Netweaver RFC Connector and SAP Netweaver Application Server by means of standard RFC protocol. It combines an
easy-to-use standard business APIs provided by SAP with unprecedented performance for KTern.AI's analysis, processing using

The RFC communication is achieved through the secured SAP gateway via 33xx port, where xx is the instance number of the
corresponding SAP ECC / SAP S/4HANA system. As the integration is viewed in terms of technical interoperability, the
enablement of application users and the client IT team is ensured for better transparency and viability in the overall process of KTern.AI On-Premise RFC communication.
