Every organization is unique and has its own business process. SAP’s standard software cannot cover all the business processes completely. Therefore, to meet the individual requirements of organizations, the standard SAP software is customized or adapted to suit the business needs. You can enhance SAP’s standard software through custom objects.

What will happen to these customizations when you migrate from SAP ECC to SAP S/4HANA? KTern performs the Custom Objects Assessment precisely to find out this information.

KTern automates the process of SAP custom object analytics. As a result, this section gives you an analytical view of the custom objects present in the system. After connecting an ECC system, KTern runs the custom object analytics check and determines the custom objects present in a system. You can gain analytical insights on the following:

1. Most relevant Custom packages with respect to the number of objects
2. Frequently used custom transactions/reports
3. Top x custom object stakeholders
4. Top x custom object types
5. Top SAP Reference Notes for impacted cases
6. Change of existing functionality, and much more

KTern also provides a summary of the Enhancements and Modifications that are going to be impacted during the transition from ECC to S/4HANA. This is particularly helpful because there is only a minute difference between Enhancements and Modifications.

Enhancement in SAP is adding or modifying the logic of SAP standard program without modifying the standard object. It consists of customer exit, Business transaction event (BTE) and Business add-ins (BADI).

Modification in SAP is adding or modifying the logic of standard program by modifying SAP standard object.

Another fascinating feature of KTern’s Custom Objects Assessment is that is gives a summary of all the impacted cases as well as the optimization cases based on the level of impact – High impact, Medium impact and Low impact. This will help you to prioritize the highly impacted custom objects first.

KTern provides a detailed and comprehensive analysis of each impacted custom program and custom object. Based on the information provided by KTern, you can plan your SAP S/4HANA Migration with confidence.

You can easily estimate the required amount of time and effort for the conversion, the number of resources required, the number of mock-conversion runs to be planned etc. You can prioritize your custom code remediation. The high frequency, high impact score custom code and objects can be remediated first. You can also archive certain unused custom objects after evaluating its functional importance and taking a call with the business stakeholders.

## Custom Object Analytics

You can create several custom transactions, tables, reports and objects in your SAP system. However, before moving to S/4HANA, it is necessary to analyze all the custom objects in order to determine the most used objects and to retire some custom objects. Without a single unified view of all the custom objects, it is very difficult to figure this out. However, KTern is here to save the day.

KTern automates the process of SAP custom object analytics. As a result, this section gives you an analytical view of the custom objects present in the system. After connecting an ECC system, KTern runs the custom object analytics check and determines the custom objects present in a system. The custom objects are then grouped based on the custom packages, the stakeholder who created it, the type of custom object and the frequency of usage.

In addition, you can also sort and search the custom objects according to the object types, custom packages, object owner, and the frequency of custom object usage. Hence, this enables you to determine the most used and least used custom objects.
With this feature of KTern, you can gain analytical insights on the following:

1. Custom packages with respect to the number of objects
2. Frequently used custom transactions/reports
3. Top x custom object stakeholders
4. Top x custom object types
5. Custom objects summary, and much more

Typically, one of the first questions a stakeholder asks to determine the weight and complexity of the ECC system is: What is the total number of custom objects in the system? KTern provides the answer to the above question and much more additional insights in just a click of the button. You can also use this feature to indirectly determine the timeline and effort of an SAP S/4HANA system conversion project.

## Custom Object Impact Analytics

Using the custom code impact analysis feature of KTern in SAP S/4HANA assessment, you can assess and analyze the syntactical change impact of all the custom Z tables, Z programs, and Z objects. It is a pre-requisite to check the impact on the standard SAP code and the custom code before moving to S/4HANA. Without completing this step, you cannot proceed further in the system conversion process.

KTern automates the process of SAP custom code impact analysis. As a result, this section gives you an analytical view of the custom code present in an SAP ECC system. After connecting an ECC system, KTern runs the custom code impact analytics check and analyzes the custom programs and objects present in a system.

The key activities that can be performed using KTern with respect to the custom code are:

1. Identification of affected custom objects
2. Scope definition of custom code migration
3. Define which custom code needs to be taken to S/4HANA
4. Define usage frequency
5. Custom code analysis parameters
6. Syntactically incompatible change of existing functionality
7. Functionality not available but functional equivalent available
8. Functionality not available
9. Change of existing functionality with a performance impact

You can also upload the custom objects by exporting from SCMON.

## Custom Object Dashboard

The Custom Code Dashboard also provides a chart depicting a usage vs impact score of the custom objects. This helps in prioritizing the high impact code with a high frequency of usage. You can eliminate the low usage custom programs and objects after taking a call with the business stakeholders.

Based on the information provided by KTern, you can plan your SAP S/4HANA system conversion with confidence.

KTern’s AI-powered rule engine automatically calculates the impact score of a custom program based on its analysis parameters and the number of impact cases. For example, if the custom program has many impact cases and its equivalent functionality is not available in S/4HANA, then it is given a high impact score.

KTern also provides the roadmap and effort for the S/4HANA system conversion based on the results from the custom code impact analysis.
