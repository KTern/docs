Once the project is created, you can invite other project members and stakeholders (both from the system integrator side and the customer side) into KTern, so that everyone has a clear view on the happenings of the project. Inviting users is a simple one-step process.

While inviting the users, you can also define the hierarchy of team members and the access levels. There are four access levels in KTern – Limited, Basic, Standard and Super.

Based on the project hierarchy assigned while inviting the users, KTern automatically generates an organization structure. This will help you get a clear understanding of the reporting structure, sign-off structure and escalation matrix within the project.
