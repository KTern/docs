- #### Test Case Auto-Recommendations

  - S/4HANA transition and business specific aligned value, volume, velocity & impact based automated testing recommendations
  - The VVV Scoring Dashboard covers the Value, Velocity, and Volume Analysis of the business per transaction usage. There could be ‘n’ number of business processes in a system. This dashboard identifies the critical business processes and prioritizes the test cases which must be tested based on the following factors:
    - **Value** - This score denotes the merit and significance of the transactional execution for the business scenario.
    - **Volume** - This score denotes the magnitude of the data and documents obtained from the transactional execution of the business scenario.
    - **Velocity** - This score denotes the frequency of the transactional execution for the corresponding business scenario.
