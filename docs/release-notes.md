   Happy New Year, everyone… We’re back after the holidays with some cool features and improvements.
### What's new
#### 1. Interlinking between Workitems and Processes
Oftentimes, the System Integrator would run an SAP S/4HANA project with ACTIVATE methodology and the Custom would have a set of Business Processes that he/she must be map into SAP. With this feature, you can combine your Processes with SAP ACTIVATE methodology. You can holistically view all your Processes being mapped to SAP ACTIVATE in a single screen or dashboard.

Did we use too many jargons there? Okay, in simple terms, here are some examples of what you can do with this new feature.

-  Have a look at the different tasks against a single process item
-  Find out the issues and its respective status against a single process item
-  Find out the test cases against a single process item
-  Go through the meetings, files and bugs against a single process item

#### 2. Workbooks within GSI

You don’t have to manage with just tables anymore. We’ve brought in the Workbook feature within GSI. In other words, you can perform activities such as bulk-upload and bulk-edit within the Global Scope Items Catalogue.

#### 3. Sign-offs update

There are quite a few updates that we’ve brought in within the Sign-Off cockpit.

-  You can create custom labels for each sign-off item and group it according to these labels. For example, you can create custom labels for process-specific sign-offs, fit-gap analysis related sign-offs, closure specific sign-offs and then view them as and when required

-  We’ve also brought in a hierarchical view of all the stakeholders who must approve a sign-off item. And also, a summary of who has and hasn’t approved that particular sign-off

### Improvements and Bug fixes

-  In ‘My Workspace’ by just hovering over a particular task, or any workitem for that matter, you can find out the ‘Work Package’ and ‘Parent’ that particular task belongs to. So, you no longer have to go into a particular task to find out its context.

-  There are a few improvements and fixes in the Control Center in terms of adding and deleting risk items

-  In the Timeline, we have introduced the ‘Participants’ column. So, you can add, update, bulk-update the participants against each task

-  You can now clone any sign-off item for quick creation of similar sign off items

### What’s improved

1. <strong>The Sign-Off Cockpit:</strong> That’s right. The Sign-off cockpit is one of the most happening places within the KTern application. That’s why we heard all your feedback and made it a lot better.

   -  The sign-off stakeholder can now request the sign-off creator for re-approvals. So, say goodbye to those follow-up emails and new sign-off requests
   -  The sign-off approver can reject a sign-off item with comments. No more breaking your head on why a particular item was not approved
   -  You can have a more controlled approval mechanism per sign-off item. Meaning, the L2 level approvers can sign-off an item without all the L1 level approvers signing-off the item. Brings in more transparency and a lot less hassles

2. <strong>Digital Process Cockpit:</strong> It’s just with the previous update that we released the much-awaited Industry-specific Global Scope Items (GSI) Cockpit. We have enhanced it further and added filters and table views in the Catalog to make your experience better and smoother.

### Improvements and Bug fixes

1. You might have to attend several meetings during the course of the project, and some of these meetings may be similar. Therefore, you can simply duplicate the summary section of similar meetings. It can save up a lot of time writing those boring meeting notes
2. Have complete control over the kind of notifications that you get from KTern. We now allow the users to set and edit their notification preferences
3. <strong>Bug Fix: </strong> Sometimes, when had to open a particular workitem in a new tab, KTern would have asked you to login again. That’s annoying, right? So, we fixed that issue. Everything should be running smoother now.
