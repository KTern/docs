### What’s improved

1. <strong>The Sign-Off Cockpit:</strong> That’s right. The Sign-off cockpit is one of the most happening places within the KTern application. That’s why we heard all your feedback and made it a lot better.

   -  The sign-off stakeholder can now request the sign-off creator for re-approvals. So, say goodbye to those follow-up emails and new sign-off requests
   -  The sign-off approver can reject a sign-off item with comments. No more breaking your head on why a particular item was not approved
   -  You can have a more controlled approval mechanism per sign-off item. Meaning, the L2 level approvers can sign-off an item without all the L1 level approvers signing-off the item. Brings in more transparency and a lot less hassles

2. <strong>Digital Process Cockpit:</strong> It’s just with the previous update that we released the much-awaited Industry-specific Global Scope Items (GSI) Cockpit. We have enhanced it further and added filters and table views in the Catalog to make your experience better and smoother.

### Improvements and Bug fixes

1. You might have to attend several meetings during the course of the project, and some of these meetings may be similar. Therefore, you can simply duplicate the summary section of similar meetings. It can save up a lot of time writing those boring meeting notes
2. Have complete control over the kind of notifications that you get from KTern. We now allow the users to set and edit their notification preferences
3. <strong>Bug Fix: </strong> Sometimes, when had to open a particular workitem in a new tab, KTern would have asked you to login again. That’s annoying, right? So, we fixed that issue. Everything should be running smoother now.

### Improvements

2. Sign-offs is the one place where most debates, discussions and tussles take place. That’s why we have added the Discussions and Files tab in the Sign-Off wizard

3. If you found yourself searching for files that you upload in various tasks, meetings and sign-offs, and ended up wasting a lot of time without any success, worry not. You can now find all these files in the ‘Files Repository’ under Project Hub

5. Created a task, issue or milestone by mistake? We heard you. You don’t have to find a work-around anymore, You can simply delete them.
