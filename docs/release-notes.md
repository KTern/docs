3. If you found yourself searching for files that you upload in various tasks, meetings and sign-offs, and ended up wasting a lot of time without any success, worry not. You can now find all these files in the ‘Files Repository’ under Project Hub

5. Created a task, issue or milestone by mistake? We heard you. You don’t have to find a work-around anymore, You can simply delete them.
