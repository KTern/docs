Upon launching the Digital Labs of KTern, you will be taken to the Test Suite Cockpit. It contains three sub-sections: Test Catalog, Auto Recommendations and Auto Import. It also includes the Test Suite Dashboard and the Sign-Off Wizard.

### Test Catalog

The test catalog contains the universal list of all the test plans, test scenarios and test cases. It acts as a launchpad from where you can execute the various test cases. The Test Catalog contains the test plans, test scenarios, and the test cases in a hierarchical manner. Each plan can have “n” scenarios under it which in turn can contain “n” test cases. Each of the plan, scenario and test case has a description, related module, testing type and priority assigned adjacent to it.
